                      Many grains, including rice, millet, corn, and sorghum, are used to
                      make beers in different areas of the world, but the key grain used in
                      brewing western-style beers is barley. This prevalence is not just a
                      matter of historical coincidence: Barley has what you might call an
                      enzymatic toolbox that makes it the perfect brewing ingredient. Like
                      most grasses, barley has a fairly simple anatomy. For brewers, the
                      spike at the top is the important part of the barley plant, because it
                      is where the seeds sit. The structure of the spike varies
                      significantly among different strains of barley, and those different
                      structures are keenly relevant to brewing beer. Spikes can vary in the
                      number of rows of seeds they bear, in multiples of two: two, four, and
                      six. And although more might intuitively seem better, six is not
                      necessarily the preferred row number. Indeed, European brewers
                      overwhelmingly prefer two-row barley. The barley seed is layered, a
                      property that is important for understanding why it is the preferred
                      cereal for making beer. And it is the tiny sliver of seed tissue
                      called the aleurone layer that is critical in brewing.

                      <p>
                      An "ageing barrel" is used to age wine; distilled spirits such as
                      whiskey, brandy, or rum; beer; tabasco sauce; or (in smaller sizes)
                      traditional balsamic vinegar. When a wine or spirit ages in a barrel,
                      small amounts of oxygen are introduced as the barrel lets some air in
                      (compare to microoxygenation where oxygen is deliberately added).
                      Oxygen enters a barrel when water or alcohol is lost due to
                      evaporation, a portion known as the "angels' share". In an environment
                      with 100% relative humidity, very little water evaporates and so most
                      of the loss is alcohol, a useful trick if one has a wine with very
                      high proof. Most beverages are topped up from other barrels to prevent
                      significant oxidation, although others such as vin jaune and sherry
                      are not. Beverages aged in wooden barrels take on some of the
                      compounds in the barrel, such as vanillin and wood tannins. The
                      presence of these compounds depends on many factors, including the
                      place of origin, how the staves were cut and dried, and the degree of
                      "toast" applied during manufacture. Barrels used for aging are
                      typically made of French or American oak, but chestnut and redwood are
                      also used. Some Asian beverages (e.g., Japanese sake) use Japanese
                      cedar, which imparts an unusual, minty-piney flavor. In Peru and
                      Chile, a grape distillate named pisco is either aged in oak or in
                      earthenware.

                      <p>
                      A honey bee (also spelled honeybee) is a eusocial flying insect within
                      the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to mainland
                      Afro-Eurasia.[1][2] After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and
                      Eurasia, humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan
                      distribution of honey bees, introducing multiple subspecies into South
                      America (early 16th century), North America (early 17th century), and
                      Australia (early 19th century).[1] Honey bees are known for their
                      construction of perennial colonial nests from wax, the large size of
                      their colonies, and surplus production and storage of honey,
                      distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many
                      animals, including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers.
